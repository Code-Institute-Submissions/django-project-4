# Milestone Project: Pixie Games

This project focuses on the website development for an e-commerce store that sells games and allows users to leave reviews. The website is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. It is targeted towards users interested in purchasing games and being involved in the community. The website aims to advertise the game in an appealing and positive manner which would drive sales.

## Project Skeleton
### (i) Existing Features
- Homepage
The slideshow gives users a peek into the games sold at the site. Additionally, the short introduction of the website gives users a little more detail about how to go about using the site.  There is a collapsable navigation bar on the top-right hand corner of the homepage. This was placed to give users an easier access to navigate the different pages easily and quickly. Upon clicking the icon, the icon will open a full screen overlay for users to see the different pages in the website. 

- About
Bootstrap features like cards were used to explain the various features of the gameplay. Another Bootstrap feature that was used in the about page was the carousel images, to showcase the screenshots taken from the game. The image under the Expansion Pack section is a link to the official video game page, which gives more information. 

- Buy Now
In the buy now page, users can visit the official social media sites to learn more about the game 
and connect with the game community. Apart from that they will be able to purchase the game in the platform of their choice. At the bottom of the page, users will be able to input their email address and subscribe to the latest news and updates.

### (ii) Features to implement in the future
In the future, I would like to include more information about the expansion packs and the 
season pass so as to give users more of a choice when it comes to what they want to buy. 

In the about page, I would like to have more images and information about the different characters in the game. I also think including a buy now button will increase and drive sales.

I would also like to include more interactive elements in the buy now page that would achieve the end goal of persuading users to buy the game. These interactive elements could be in the form of image hover overlay, an animated buy now button, etc. 

###Limitation 
There is also a subscription form at the bottom of the page,
although clicking on the submit button will not navigate away from the website. (There is no Javascript). This would be a feature to implement in the future.

## Project Surface
### Design Choices
(i) The color scheme of orange and black reflects the main theme of the overall game and hence why it is consistently used throughout the website. I also believe that the colour scheme will appeal to users.
(ii) The font looks fun and appeals to gamers. It also reflects the game and the gameplay.
(iii) A scrollable parallax image was included in the buy now page to give the webpage more depth. I also believe the juxtaposition of the image and the subscription form will enable and encourage users to buy and subscribe to the game. An active subscription is equally important as a purchase as it measures the individual's interest level and allows developers to push more news and updates to their email so as to attain the goal of a purchase if the user has not already bought the game.
